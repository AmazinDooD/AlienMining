## Funny silly incremental game.

### To build from source (if you're a lunatic)
1. Download the source code via Code > Download ZIP
2. Extract the files.
3. Make sure you have [vite](https://vite.dev), [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.
4. Open a command prompt at the root directory (the folder containing index.html)
5. Run `npm install tslib`
6. Run `npm run dev` or `vite`
7. Click on the link in the terminal.
