Sometimes GitHub Pages doesn't really work, if that happens:
1. Download the source code via Code > Download ZIP
2. Extract the files.
3. Make sure you have vite and npm installed.
4. Open a command prompt at the root directory (the folder containing index.html)
5. Run `npm run dev` or `vite`
6. Click on the link in the terminal.
